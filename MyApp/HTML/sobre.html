            <p> "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized 
            by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that 
            are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the 
            same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. 
            In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we 
            like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the 
            claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and 
            annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he 
            rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
